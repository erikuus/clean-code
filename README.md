# Introduction

## About the gitbook

This is my **summary** of the book "**Clean Code**" by **Robert C. Martin**.

In the book Robert C. Martin introduces the **disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of** **true software craftsmanship**.

In this gitbook I ****summarize **the key principles and strategies I found most valuable in the book**. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that I use my own PHP code to illustrate the key points. The Clean Code book is mostly written from a Java perspective.

## About the author

I am an experienced Software Engineer. Skilled in SQL, PHP and Javascript. 

I don't think any software can be fundamentally important. I feel that even if all possible problems that software can solve are solved, the problems of life have still not been touched at all. And still, I am passionate about my work. I have adopted Software Craftsmanship ideology.

> Software Craftsmanship is about professionalism in software development. Besides promoting many technical practices and ways in which developers can get better at writing good and well-crafted code, it also promotes the idea that developers should do far more to help their clients than just writing code.  
> _â€” Sandro Mancuso "The Software Craftsman"_

Seniority is relative. Having fifteen years of experience with PHP \(Yii Framework\) in National Archives of Estonia will not make me senior developer in another context and technology. Therefore I am ready to start over again as an apprentice, if only I can work for a project that makes me passionate and will teach new skills.
