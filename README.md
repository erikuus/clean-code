# Introduction

## About the gitbook

This is my **summary** of the book "**Clean Code**" by **Robert C. Martin**.

In the book Robert C. Martin introduces the **disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of** **true software craftsmanship**.

In this gitbook I **\*\*summarize** the key principles and strategies I found most valuable in the book\*\*.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that I use PHP code to illustrate the key points. The Clean Code book is mostly written from a Java perspective.
