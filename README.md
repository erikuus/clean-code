# Clean Code
My summary of the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin

In the book Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship.

In this repository I summarize the key principles and strategies I found most valuable in the book. Please note that I use my own PHP code to illustrate the key points. The Clean Code book is mostly written from a Java perspective.
