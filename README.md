# Introduction

This is my **summary** of the book "**Clean Code**" by Robert C. Martin.

In the book Robert C. Martin introduces the **disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of** **true software craftsmanship**.

In this gitbook **I summarize the key principles and strategies I found most valuable in the book**. Please note that I use my own PHP code to illustrate the key points. The Clean Code book is mostly written from a Java perspective.
