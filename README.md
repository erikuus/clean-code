# Introduction

## About the gitbook

This is my **summary** of the book [**Clean Code**](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook-dp-B001GSTOAM/dp/B001GSTOAM/) by **Robert C. Martin**.

In the book Robert C. Martin introduces the **disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of** **true software craftsmanship**.

In this gitbook I **summarize the key principles and strategies** I found most valuable in the book.

Please note that I use PHP code to illustrate the key points. The Clean Code book is mostly written from a Java perspective.
