# Functions

## Functions should be small

## Functions should do one thing

## Avoid nested structures

## Follow the stepdown rule

## Use descriptive names

## Use few arguments

## Avoid flag arguments

## Have No Side Effects

## Separate command from query

## Prefer exceptions to returning error codes

## Put all code inside try block

## Write, test and refine

> When I write functions, they come out long and complicated. But I also have unit tests that cover every one of those clumsy lines of code. So then I massage and refine that code, splitting out functions, changing names, eliminating duplication.  
> â€” Robert C. Martin
