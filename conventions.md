In this gitbook, you will find two types of text boxes that distinguish between good and bad practices.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Bad practices appear in a box like this.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

Occasionally you will find a blue box of comments.

{% hint style="info" %}
Important comments appear in a blue box.
{% endhint %}
